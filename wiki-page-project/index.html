        <b>Crown shyness</b> (also<i>canopy, disengaement,<sup>[1]</sup>
            canopy shyness,<sup>[2]</sup> or inter-crown
            spacing<sup>[3]</sup></i>)
            is a phenomenon observed in some tree species, in which
            the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each other,
            forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.<sup>[4][5]</sup>
            The phenomenon is the most prevalent among trees of the same
            species but also occurs between trees of different species.
            <sup>[6][7]</sup> 
            There exist many hypotheses as to why crown
            shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests that it
            might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>
